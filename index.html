        /* Application Structure Plan: Single-page app with tab/section navigation (Home, Gear Up, Rigging, Seasonal Almanac, NC Pier Guide, Etiquette/Safety, Hot Tips, Closed Piers, Ask Clyde AI). The Pier Guide will be central, allowing regional selection and detailed views of individual piers. The Seasonal Almanac will use an interactive table for fish by season. This structure is chosen to organize the rich textual and tabular data logically, making it easy for users to find specific information relevant to their fishing plans, rather than a linear read. */

            <h2>Welcome, Young Angler!</h2>
            <p>This isn't just a guide; it's an invitation. An invitation to step onto the pier, feel the salty breeze, cast your line, and discover the calm, the thrill, and the quiet wisdom that only fishing can offer. You've got that fantastic PENN Wrath II 10' 8000 combo â€“ that's a serious piece of gear, and it tells me you're ready to get serious about fishing. Iâ€™ve spent countless hours on these North Carolina piers, learned a thing or two, and I'm here to share it all with you. So, let's dive in!</p>
            <h3>Your Battle Station: The PENN Wrath II Combo</h3>
            <p>Your PENN Wrath II 10' 8000 combo is a powerhouse, perfect for the kind of fishing we do off these piers. It's tough, reliable, and it's going to be your best friend out there.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>10-foot Rod:</strong> This long rod is your secret weapon. It lets you launch your bait way out there, reaching those fish that hang out in deeper water. The extra length also helps keep your line up and away from the pier's pilings and other folks' lines, which is super important in a busy spot. Plus, when you hook into a big one, this length gives you the leverage you need to safely bring that fish up to the deck.</li>
                <li><strong>8000-Size Reel:</strong> This reel is a true workhorse. It's built to handle the saltwater, holding plenty of strong line for those hard-fighting fish that like to make long runs. Its powerful drag system means you've got the stopping power to tire out stubborn fish and keep your line from snapping.</li>
            </ul>

                <div class="details-content mt-2">
                    <h4>Monofilament Backing:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> Get a small spool, maybe 100-150 yards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Look for 20-30 lb test monofilament.</li>
                        <li><strong>Why:</strong> Your filler. Affordable, keeps braided line from slipping.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Braided Main Line:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> Aim for a 200-300 yard spool.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Pick up 50-65 lb test braided line.</li>
                        <li><strong>Why:</strong> Super strong, thin, casts far, no stretch for sensitivity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Color:</strong> Bright (yellow/green) for visibility, or dark (green/blue) for camouflage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Fluorocarbon Leader Material:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> A small spool, 25-50 yards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Get 30-60 lb test fluorocarbon.</li>
                        <li><strong>Why:</strong> CRUCIAL! Almost invisible underwater, super tough against scrapes.</li>

                    <h4>Pyramid Sinkers:</h4>
                    <p>3 oz are great for strong currents. Clyde's Tip: Get 1 oz and 2 oz too for versatility.</p>
                    <h4>Circle Hooks:</h4>
                    <p>Assorted Sizes (2/0 - 8/0). Corner-of-mouth hooking, healthier for release. Match to bait.</p>
                    <h4>Swivels:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Heavy-Duty Barrel Swivels (Size 4-6):</strong> Prevent line twist.</li>
                        <li><strong>Snap Swivels (Size 4-6):</strong> Quick rig/lure changes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Fish-Finder Slides:</h4>
                    <p>Let line slide freely, fish won't feel sinker weight.</p>
                    <h4>Sabiki Rigs:</h4>
                    <p>Multi-fly rigs for catching baitfish (pinfish, cigar minnows).</p>
                    <h4>Leader Material (Extra Heavy):</h4>
                    <p>Small spool of 60-80 lb mono/fluoro for super-tough leaders for big/toothy fish.</p>

                    <h4>Live Bait:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Live Shrimp:</strong> Candy for almost any pier fish.</li>
                        <li><strong>Live Finger Mullet, Pinfish, Croaker:</strong> Excellent for bigger, predatory fish like Red Drum, Flounder, Spanish Mackerel.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Fresh Dead Bait:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Squid:</strong> Tough, stays on hook, lots of different bottom fish love it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cut Bait:</strong> Freshly cut pieces of mullet, pilchards, or Spanish mackerel are like a dinner bell for larger game fish.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Artificial Lures (Optional, but Fun!):</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Spoons (Kastmaster, Sting Silver):</strong> Great for Spanish mackerel and bluefish when they're actively chasing bait.</li>
                        <li><strong>Jigs (bucktails, soft plastics):</strong> Very versatile, can catch a wide range of fish.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gotcha Plugs:</strong> A classic pier lure, especially effective for Spanish mackerel and bluefish.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Bait Shop Tip:</strong> ALWAYS ask local pier bait shop staff what's biting! Their advice is golden.</p>

                    <h4>Monofilament Backing (50-100 yards of 20-30 lb mono):</h4>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
                        <li>Tie mono to reel spool using an Arbor Knot. Pull tight.</li>
                        <li>Wind on 50-100 yards of mono.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Pro Method for Perfect Fill:</strong> Spool braid first. Tie mono backing to braid end, fill spool to 1/8 inch from rim. Wind all line off to separate spool. Wind back onto reel, mono first, then braid. Perfect fill!</p>
                    <h4>Braided Main Line (200-300 yards of 50-65 lb braid):</h4>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
                        <li>Connect braid to mono backing with Double Uni Knot.</li>
                        <li>Wind braid tightly and evenly, maintaining firm tension. Fill to 1/8 inch (or less) from spool edge. DO NOT overfill (causes wind knots).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Fluorocarbon Leader (3-6 feet of 30-60 lb fluorocarbon):</h4>
                    <p>Crucial knot! Tied directly to braided main line.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clyde's Top Knot: The FG Knot.</strong> Incredibly strong, super thin, slides through guides smoothly. Worth the practice! (Search YouTube for tutorials).</li>
                        <li><strong>Solid Alternative: The Double Uni Knot.</strong> Strong, reliable backup if FG Knot is tricky.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why a long leader?</strong> Tough against pier/barnacle scrapes, toothy fish. Room for multiple re-ties.</p>

                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
                        <li>Slide fish-finder slide onto fluorocarbon leader.</li>

                        <li>Tie heavy-duty barrel swivel (e.g., size 4) to end of fluorocarbon leader.</li>
                        <li>To other side of swivel, tie a 12-24 inch piece of stout fluorocarbon leader material (say, 40-60 lb test) â€“ this short piece is called the "leader" or "hook snell."</li>
                        <li>Finally, tie a circle hook (e.g., 4/0 to 8/0, match bait) to the end of that short leader.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Bait Tip:</strong> Load this rig with live shrimp, whole dead shrimp, or hearty cut bait like mullet or squid.</p>

                    <h4>How to Rig:</h4>
                    <p>Tie a spoon (like a Kastmaster or Sting Silver) or a Gotcha plug directly to the end of your fluorocarbon leader.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Tooth Advisory:</strong> If you're consistently catching toothy critters like bluefish or Spanish mackerel that are cutting your leader, consider adding a short (6-12 inch) piece of 30-50 lb monofilament or light wire leader between your fluorocarbon and the lure. Attach it with a small snap swivel. This little addition can save you a lot of lures!</p>

                    <p><strong>Best For:</strong> This is your ticket to catching your own live bait. Fresh, live bait is almost always the best for tempting bigger fish!</p>
                    <h4>How to Rig:</h4>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
                        <li>Tie the Sabiki rig directly to your braided main line (no leader needed for Sabiki).</li>
                        <li>Attach a small sinker (1/2 - 1 oz) to the bottom snap of the Sabiki.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Technique:</strong> When you see small baitfish dimpling the surface or hear about bait schools, drop your Sabiki down and gently jig it up and down. Those tiny flies will trick the baitfish into biting.</p>

                    <p><strong>Target Fish:</strong> King Mackerel (near T-heads, requires king rigs/live bait), Spanish Mackerel, Bluefish, Shark (various, heavy tackle/wire leaders), Tarpon (southern piers, large live baits), Flounder (pilings/structure), Sheepshead (barnacle-covered pilings, fiddler crabs/clam/shrimp), Spot, Croaker, Sea Mullet.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Summer Tip:</strong> Head out early to beat the heat and crowds. Fishing at night can be very productive for certain species under the pier lights. Consider a longer rod for casting over distant schools.</p>

                    <p><strong>Clyde's Winter Tip:</strong> Go on warmer, sunny days. Fish often congregate in deeper water or around warm outfalls. Bites can be very subtle; sensitivity is key.</p>

            <h2>Carolina Clyde's Pier Etiquette & Safety Guide</h2>
            <p>Follow these rules, earn respect, and have a safer, more enjoyable time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Respect the Space:</strong> Piers get crowded. Be mindful of others' lines and give room. Don't cast too close to another angler.</li>
                <li><strong>Look Before You Cast:</strong> Always glance around to ensure your cast won't tangle lines or hit anyone.</li>
                <li><strong>Clean Up Your Act:</strong> Dispose of all trash, old line, and bait containers in designated bins.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect the Fish:</strong> If not keeping, release quickly and gently. Learn proper handling and use a de-hooker.</li>
                <li><strong>Know the Rules:</strong> CRITICAL! Check NC fishing regulations for licenses, size/bag limits (NC Division of Marine Fisheries website).</li>
                <li><strong>Safety First:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Watch for slippery spots, exposed nails, loose boards.</li>
                        <li>Pay attention to weather forecasts, especially lightning. Head inside if a storm brews.</li>
                        <li>Have a basic first-aid kit.</li>
                        <li>Use a drop net for all but the smallest fish. NEVER hoist a large fish with just rod/reel â€“ you'll snap your rod, lose fish, or both.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
             <h3>Important Considerations for Pier Fishing:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pier Fees:</strong> Most private piers charge daily fees. State-owned piers also have fees. This usually covers your blanket fishing license for that pier.</li>
                <li><strong>Check Reports:</strong> Always check the pier's website or call for current fishing reports.</li>
                <li><strong>Crowds:</strong> Popular piers can get very crowded. Patience and pier etiquette are key.</li>
                <li><strong>Pier Rules:</strong> Each pier has specific rules (bait, rods, gaffing, fish cleaning). Read them upon arrival.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Carolina Clyde's Hot Tips for Pier Success</h2>
            <p>Little things that make a big difference.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fish the Tides:</strong> Fish activity is tied to water movement. Aim for one hour before/after high tide and one hour before/after low tide. Slack periods (tide changing) are often prime feeding times.</li>
                <li><strong>Go Early/Late:</strong> Dawn and dusk are often best. Low light brings out fish, usually quieter on the pier.</li>
                <li><strong>Observe Like a Hawk:</strong> Watch successful anglers. What rigs/bait are they using? Where are they casting? Local knowledge is invaluable.</li>
                <li><strong>Fish the Structure:</strong> Pier pilings, submerged reefs, changes in bottom depth attract fish seeking food/shelter. Cast near these.</li>
                <li><strong>Read the Water:</strong> Look for baitfish signs (ripples, jumping fish), diving birds. Subtle water color changes can point to deeper pockets.</li>
                <li><strong>Patience is a Virtue:</strong> Fishing isn't always constant action. Enjoy the quiet. The bite can turn on suddenly!</li>
                <li><strong>Master Your Knots:</strong> Practice at home, especially the FG Knot. A strong knot is your strongest link to the fish.</li>
                <li><strong>Set Your Drag Correctly:</strong> Drag should let line peel steadily when fish pulls hard, without breaking. Start at ~1/3 of leader's breaking strength. Check by pulling line from reel before casting.</li>
                <li><strong>Bring a Rod Holder:</strong> Sand spike or pier-specific holder keeps rod secure.</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace the Journey:</strong> Fishing is about learning, adapting, connecting with nature, building character. Share knowledge, celebrate successes, learn from challenges.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="closed-piers" class="page-content content-section" style="display: none;">
            <h2>Important Advisory: Currently Closed Piers</h2>
            <p>The dynamic nature of coastal infrastructure means pier accessibility can change. Always verify a pier's operational status before your trip.</p>
            <h3>A. Holden Beach Pier: Current Status and Impact on Fishing</h3>
            <p>The Holden Beach Pier is presently <strong>closed for fishing</strong> and will remain so until further notice. The Town of Holden Beach, which recently acquired the pier properties, conducted an assessment revealing that the structure has "likely surpassed its remaining service life" and requires immediate, substantial maintenance. Both the pier and its adjacent buildings are currently inaccessible to the public.</p>
            <p>This closure represents a significant loss of a key fishing location in the southern coastal region. Anglers should seek alternatives like Ocean Isle Beach Pier or consider charter services.</p>
            <h3>B. Carolina Beach Pier: Current Status and Impact on Fishing</h3>
            <p>Similarly, the Carolina Beach Pier is currently <strong>closed for fishing</strong> until further notice. The closure is attributed to the end of the pier being inaccessible due to anticipated repairs.</p>
            <p>Anglers planning to fish in this vicinity should explore alternatives such as Kure Beach Pier, surf fishing, or local charter services.</p>
            <p>The explicit closure of these piers due to structural deficiencies, coupled with rebuilding efforts at others like Avalon Pier, underscores a critical aspect of pier fishing: access is not guaranteed. Always verify current operational status via official websites, phone calls, or social media updates.</p>

                    <h4>Pier Profile: Length, Unique Features, History</h4>
                    <p>The Ocean Isle Beach Pier, a substantial 968-foot wooden structure, has served as a prominent landmark on the island since its construction in 1957 by Odell and Virginia Williamson. Situated centrally on the 7-mile island, at the terminus of Causeway Drive, the pier's management prioritizes upholding family traditions and honoring its rich history while concurrently implementing updates to cater to contemporary tourists. The pier complex encompasses a pier grill, a gift shop, an arcade featuring a large, modern, and air-conditioned room, and an ice cream parlor renowned for its Blue Bell hand-dipped and soft-serve ice cream. Anglers benefit from strategically placed wooden benches along the pier's entire length, providing comfortable spots for casting and observation.</p>
