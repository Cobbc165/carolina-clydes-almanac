            <h2>Welcome, Angler!</h2>
            <p>This isn't just a guide; it's an invitation. An invitation to step onto the pier, feel the salty breeze, cast your line, and discover the calm, the thrill, and the quiet wisdom that only fishing can offer. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, there's always something new to learn on these North Carolina piers. I’ve spent countless hours out there, learned a thing or two, and I'm here to share it all with you. So, let's dive in!</p>
            <h3>Clyde's Recommended Starter Combo: The PENN Wrath II</h3>
            <p>If you're looking to get serious about pier fishing, a reliable setup is your best friend out there. Carolina Clyde recommends the PENN Wrath II 10' 8000 combo as a fantastic powerhouse. It's tough, dependable, and a great choice for handling the diverse conditions and fish you'll encounter off these piers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>10-foot Rod:</strong> This long rod is your secret weapon. It lets you launch your bait way out there, reaching those fish that hang out in deeper water. The extra length also helps keep your line up and away from the pier's pilings and other folks' lines, which is super important in a busy spot. Plus, when you hook into a big one, this length gives you the leverage you need to safely bring that fish up to the deck.</li>
                <li><strong>8000-Size Reel:</strong> This reel is a true workhorse. It's built to handle the saltwater, holding plenty of strong line for those hard-fighting fish that like to make long runs. Its powerful drag system means you've got the stopping power to tire out stubborn fish and keep your line from snapping.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Clyde's Essential Pier Fishing Shopping List & Spooling</h2>
            <details class="mb-5">
                <summary class="details-summary">Ideal Fishing Line (The Foundation of Success)</summary>
                <div class="details-content mt-3">
                    <h4>Monofilament Backing:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> Get a small spool, maybe 100-150 yards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Look for 20-30 lb test monofilament.</li>
                        <li><strong>Why:</strong> This is your filler. It’s affordable, and it keeps your main braided line from slipping on the reel's spool. Think of it like a solid base for a strong building.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Braided Main Line:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> Aim for a 200-300 yard spool.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Pick up 50-65 lb test braided line.</li>
                        <li><strong>Why:</strong> Braid is incredible! It's super strong for how thin it is, so you can cast it a mile. It has almost no stretch, which means you'll feel every little nibble, and when you set that hook, you'll feel it right now. It's a game-changer for sensitivity and power.</li>
                        <li><strong>Color:</strong> Bright (yellow/green) for visibility, or dark (green/blue) for camouflage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Fluorocarbon Leader Material:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> A small spool, 25-50 yards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Get 30-60 lb test fluorocarbon.</li>
                        <li><strong>Why:</strong> This is CRUCIAL! Fluoro is almost invisible underwater, which means fish won't see your line. Even better, it’s super tough against scrapes from barnacles on pilings and sharp fish teeth. This is your stealthy, strong connection to the fish.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <summary class="details-summary">Essential Terminal Tackle</summary>
                <div class="details-content mt-3">
                    <h4>Pyramid Sinkers:</h4>
                    <p>3 oz are great for strong currents. Clyde's Tip: Consider picking up some 1 oz and 2 oz pyramid sinkers too. Having different weights lets you adapt to lighter currents or shallower water, giving you more options.</p>
                    <h4>Circle Hooks:</h4>
                    <p>Assorted Sizes (2/0 - 8/0). These are my go-to hooks for bait fishing. They’re designed to hook fish right in the corner of the mouth, which is healthier for the fish if you release it. Match the hook size to the bait you're using.</p>
                    <h4>Swivels:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Heavy-Duty Barrel Swivels (Size 4-6):</strong> These are like little anti-tangle devices. They stop your line from twisting up, which can happen a lot when your bait is spinning in the current.</li>
                        <li><strong>Snap Swivels (Size 4-6):</strong> These are handy for quickly changing out your rigs or lures without having to re-tie your main line every time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Fish-Finder Slides:</h4>
                    <p>These are neat little gadgets that let your line slide freely through your sinker. This means a fish can grab your bait and swim off without feeling the weight of the sinker, making them more likely to commit to the bite.</p>
                    <h4>Sabiki Rigs:</h4>
                    <p>These are special rigs with multiple small flies designed to catch baitfish like pinfish, cigar minnows, or pilchards. Catching your own live bait is a fantastic way to increase your chances of hooking a big one!</p>
                    <h4>Leader Material (Extra Heavy):</h4>
                    <p>A small spool of heavier mono or fluoro (say, 60-80 lb) can be useful for making custom, super-tough leaders if you're targeting really big fish or those with razor-sharp teeth.</p>

                <div class="details-content mt-3">
                    <h4>Live Bait:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Live Shrimp:</strong> You can't go wrong with live shrimp. They're like candy for almost any fish on the pier.</li>
                        <li><strong>Live Finger Mullet, Pinfish, Croaker:</strong> These are excellent choices for bigger, predatory fish like Red Drum, Flounder, or Spanish Mackerel. Check your local bait shops for these, or catch them yourself with a Sabiki rig!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Fresh Dead Bait:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Squid:</strong> It's tough, it stays on the hook well, and lots of different bottom fish love it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cut Bait:</strong> Freshly cut pieces of mullet, pilchards, or Spanish mackerel are like a dinner bell for larger game fish.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Artificial Lures (Optional, but Fun!):</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Spoons (like Kastmaster or Sting Silver):</strong> Great for Spanish mackerel and bluefish when they're actively chasing bait.</li>
                        <li><strong>Jigs (like bucktails or soft plastics on jig heads):</strong> Very versatile, can catch a wide range of fish.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gotcha Plugs:</strong> A classic pier lure, especially effective for Spanish mackerel and bluefish.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Bait Shop Tip:</strong> Always, always, always ask the folks at the local pier bait shop what's biting! They're out there every day and know what bait the fish are hitting right then and there. Their advice is golden.</p>

                <summary class="details-summary">Clyde's Line Game: Spooling Your Reel (The Master's Way)</summary>
                <div class="details-content mt-3">
                    <h4>Monofilament Backing (50-100 yards of 20-30 lb mono):</h4>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
                        <li>Tie your mono to the reel spool using an Arbor Knot. Pull it nice and tight.</li>
                        <li>Wind on only 50-100 yards of mono. You don't need any more than that.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Pro Method for Perfect Fill:</strong> To get the absolute ideal amount of line, here’s what I do: spool your braid onto the reel first. Then, tie your mono backing to the end of the braid and fill the rest of the spool with mono until the line is about 1/8 inch from the rim. Once it's full, wind all the line off onto a separate spool (or even an empty soda bottle, carefully!). Finally, wind it back onto your fishing reel, starting with the mono first, then the braid. Now that reel is perfectly spooled with maximum braid!</p>
                    <h4>Braided Main Line (200-300 yards of 50-65 lb braid):</h4>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
                        <li>Connect your new braid to the end of your mono backing. The Double Uni Knot is a strong and reliable knot for this connection – easy to learn and trustworthy.</li>
                        <li>Wind your braid onto the reel tightly and evenly. This is key: maintain steady, firm tension as you reel it on. Fill the spool until the line is about 1/8 inch (or less) from the edge of the spool. Do NOT overfill, young man, because that's how you get those frustrating tangles called "wind knots" when you cast.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Fluorocarbon Leader (3-6 feet of 30-60 lb fluorocarbon):</h4>
                    <p>This is the most crucial knot you'll learn for pier fishing! This leader gets tied directly to the end of your braided main line.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clyde's Top Knot: The FG Knot.</strong> Now, this knot is a real gem. It's incredibly strong, super thin, and it slides through your rod guides like butter when you cast. It takes some practice to master, but I promise you, it's worth every bit of effort. Search "FG Knot tutorial" on YouTube – there are plenty of great videos that show you exactly how to do it. Take your time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solid Alternative: The Double Uni Knot.</strong> If the FG knot is giving you a hard time at first, don't get discouraged! The Double Uni Knot is a strong and reliable backup, even if it's a bit bulkier.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why a long leader?</strong> A 3-6 foot leader gives you plenty of line that's tough against scrapes from pier pilings, barnacles, and those toothy fish. It also gives you room for multiple re-ties if you get snagged or cut off.</p>

                <div class="details-content mt-3">
                    <p><strong>Best For:</strong> This is your setup for chasing bigger bottom fish like Red Drum, Black Drum, large catfish, or even Snook (down towards the southern piers). It’s what you need when the current is strong and you need your bait to stay put.</p>
                    <h4>How to Rig:</h4>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
                        <li>Slide a fish-finder slide onto your fluorocarbon leader. (This lets the fish take the bait without feeling the sinker's weight.)</li>
                        <li>Attach your 3 oz pyramid sinker to the fish-finder slide.</li>
                        <li>Tie a heavy-duty barrel swivel (e.g., size 4) to the very end of your fluorocarbon leader.</li>
                        <li>To the other side of that swivel, tie a 12-24 inch piece of stout fluorocarbon leader material (say, 40-60 lb test) – this short piece is called the "leader" or "hook snell."</li>
                        <li>Finally, tie a circle hook (e.g., 4/0 to 8/0, matching your bait size) to the end of that short leader.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Bait Tip:</strong> Load this rig with live shrimp, whole dead shrimp, or hearty cut bait like mullet or squid.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best For:</strong> When you see those schools of Spanish Mackerel or Bluefish chasing bait near the surface. These are active, exciting fish!</p>
                    <h4>How to Rig:</h4>
                    <p>Tie a spoon (like a Kastmaster or Sting Silver) or a Gotcha plug directly to the end of your fluorocarbon leader.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Tooth Advisory:</strong> If you're consistently catching toothy critters like bluefish or Spanish mackerel that are cutting your leader, consider adding a short (6-12 inch) piece of 30-50 lb monofilament or light wire leader between your fluorocarbon and the lure. Attach it with a small snap swivel. This little addition can save you a lot of lures!</p>

                    <p><strong>Best For:</strong> This is your ticket to catching your own live bait. Fresh, live bait is almost always the best for tempting bigger fish!</p>
                    <h4>How to Rig:</h4>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
                        <li>Tie the Sabiki rig directly to your braided main line (no leader needed for Sabiki).</li>
                        <li>Attach a small sinker (1/2 - 1 oz) to the bottom snap of the Sabiki.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Technique:</strong> When you see small baitfish dimpling the surface or hear about bait schools, drop your Sabiki down and gently jig it up and down. Those tiny flies will trick the baitfish into biting.</p>

            <h2>Carolina Clyde's Almanac: NC Pier Fishing by Season</h2>
            <p>Understanding the seasons is like having a secret map to the fish. Fish move based on water temperature, and what's biting strong today might be gone next month. (Current Date: Friday, May 30, 2025 – You're hitting the piers at a perfect time!)</p>
            
            <h3>General Seasonal Overview</h3>
            <details class="mb-4">
                <summary class="details-summary">Spring (March, April, May)</summary>
                <div class="details-content mt-3">
                    <p><strong>What's Happening:</strong> The water is warming up (50s-70s °F), and fish are waking up and moving back closer to shore. It's a time of increasing activity and migration.</p>
                    <p><strong>Target Fish:</strong>Spanish Mackerel: These sleek, fast fish arrive in big numbers, especially in April and May. Fast and aggressive.<br>Bluefish: Similar to Spanish, often caught alongside them.<br>Pompano: Highly prized, arrive in April/May. Look for them in the "suds" (surf zone).<br>Sea Mullet (Whiting), Croaker: Good numbers of these bottom fish.<br>Red Drum (Puppy Drum): Good in the surf zone and around structure.<br>Flounder: Start showing up around structure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Spring Tip:</strong> Watch the water clarity. Clearer water often means better Spanish Mackerel fishing. Pay attention to the tides, too; fish often feed most actively during incoming and outgoing tides as bait moves.</p>
                </div>
            </details>
            <details class="mb-4">
                <summary class="details-summary">Summer (June, July, August)</summary>
                <div class="details-content mt-3">
                    <p><strong>What's Happening:</strong> The water is warmest (70s-low 80s °F). Peak fishing season, but can be crowded.</p>
                    <p><strong>Target Fish:</strong>King Mackerel: Offshore species that come close to piers, especially those with T-heads or long reaches. Requires specialized "king rigs" and live bait.<br>Spanish Mackerel, Bluefish: Still abundant.<br>Shark (various species): Warm water attracts sharks. Requires heavy tackle, wire leaders, and large cut bait. (Know how to handle and release safely!)<br>Tarpon: Can show up on some southern NC piers, usually requiring large live baits.<br>Flounder: Excellent around pilings and structure.<br>Sheepshead: Very good around barnacle-covered pilings, using fiddler crabs or small pieces of clam/shrimp.<br>Spot, Croaker, Sea Mullet: Abundant bottom fishing.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Summer Tip:</strong> Head out early to beat the heat and crowds. Fishing at night can be very productive for certain species under the pier lights. Consider a longer rod for casting over distant schools.</p>
                </div>
            </details>
            <details class="mb-4">
                <summary class="details-summary">Fall (September, October, November)</summary>
                <div class="details-content mt-3">
                    <p><strong>What's Happening:</strong> The water is cooling (70s-50s °F). Often considered the best fishing season in NC as fish migrate south and feed heavily.</p>
                    <p><strong>Target Fish:</strong>Red Drum (Big Bulls): Large "bull reds" migrate close to shore, offering incredible fights.<br>Spanish Mackerel, Bluefish: Still around in good numbers, often larger.<br>Flounder: Excellent as they move towards inlets for spawning.<br>Speckled Trout: Start showing up as water cools.<br>Pompano, Whiting, Croaker: Still good bottom fishing.<br>King Mackerel: Often a strong fall run.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Fall Tip:</strong> This is prime time for big fish! Prepare your tackle for heavier fights. Pay attention to weather fronts, as fishing can be hot right before a cold snap.</p>
                </div>
            </details>
            <details class="mb-4">
                <summary class="details-summary">Winter (December, January, February)</summary>
                <div class="details-content mt-3">
                    <p><strong>What's Happening:</strong> The water is coldest (40s-50s °F). Fishing slows down, but dedicated anglers can find success.</p>
                    <p><strong>Target Fish:</strong>Red Drum (smaller "Puppy Drum"): Can be caught in deeper holes or around structure.<br>Black Drum: Often caught on bottom rigs with shrimp or crab.<br>Sheepshead: Still around pilings if water isn't too cold.<br>Speckled Trout: Can be found in deeper, warmer pockets near structure.<br>Bluefish: Occasional stragglers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clyde's Winter Tip:</strong> Go on warmer, sunny days. Fish often congregate in deeper water or around warm outfalls. Bites can be very subtle; sensitivity is key.</p>

            <p>Knowing what fish are around is one thing, but knowing *how* to catch them is the true art of pier fishing. This section will guide you through various methods, linking them to specific species, optimal conditions, and the subtle nuances that make a difference.</p>

            <h3>I. Understanding Water Patterns & Fish Movement</h3>
            <details class="mb-4">
                <summary class="details-summary">Tides and Currents: The Ocean's Rhythm</summary>
                <div class="details-content mt-3">
                    <p>Fish activity is deeply tied to the movement of water. Tides create currents that move baitfish, concentrate food sources, and position predatory fish for ambush.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Incoming Tide:</strong> Often brings cleaner, cooler water and new baitfish closer to the pier. Many species become more active during this phase.</li>
                        <li><strong>Outgoing Tide:</strong> Can concentrate baitfish and other food sources as water drains from estuaries and shallower areas, pushing them past the pier. This can also be a prime feeding time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Slack Tide (High or Low):</strong> When the tide changes direction, there's a brief period of minimal current. Bites can sometimes slow down, but for certain species, especially bottom feeders, this can be a good time as they don't have to fight a strong current.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strong Currents:</strong> Fish will often position themselves behind pilings or other structure, facing into the current, waiting for food to drift by. Cast your bait upstream of the structure to allow it to drift naturally into their strike zone.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clear Water:</strong> Often preferred by sight-feeding predators like Spanish Mackerel and King Mackerel. It also means your fluorocarbon leader is even more crucial for stealth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Murky/Turbid Water:</strong> Can reduce visibility for fish, making them rely more on scent and vibration. This can be good for bottom feeders like Drum and Catfish. Strong scents on your bait can be very effective here.</li>
                        <li><strong>Water Temperature:</strong> Fish are cold-blooded, so water temperature dictates their activity levels, migration patterns, and where they hold. This is why understanding the seasonal almanac is so vital. Fish will move to find their preferred temperature range.</li>

                    <p>Pier pilings, submerged artificial reefs, natural troughs, and sandbars all provide shelter, ambush points, and food sources for fish. Always cast near these areas, as they are prime real estate for fish.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Target Species:</strong> Sea Mullet (Whiting), Croaker, Spot, Black Drum, Red Drum (Puppy Drum), Sheepshead, Catfish.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recommended Rig:</strong> Heavy Duty Bottom Rig (Fish-Finder Slide, Barrel Swivel, Short Leader, Circle Hook). Use pyramid sinkers (1-3 oz, adjust to current).</li>
                        <li><strong>Best Baits:</strong> Live shrimp, fresh dead shrimp, squid, freshly cut bait (mullet, pilchards, Spanish mackerel). For Sheepshead, fiddler crabs are king, followed by small pieces of clam or shrimp.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Cast your rig out, let the sinker settle on the bottom. Keep your line taut but not tight, allowing fish to pick up the bait without feeling immediate resistance from the sinker. Watch your rod tip for subtle taps or a steady bend.</li>
                        <li><strong>Optimal Times:</strong> Often productive during moving tides (incoming or outgoing), and can be successful day or night.</li>

                        <li><strong>Recommended Rig:</strong> Casting Rig (Spoon like Kastmaster or Sting Silver, or a Gotcha Plug tied directly to your fluorocarbon leader). Consider a light wire leader for toothy bluefish or Spanish if they're cutting your line.</li>
                        <li><strong>Best Baits/Lures:</strong> Metal spoons, Gotcha plugs, small jigs (bucktails, soft plastics on jig heads).</li>
                        <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Cast your lure as far as you can towards the schooling fish or diving birds. Retrieve it quickly and steadily. Spanish Mackerel love a fast retrieve. Bluefish are less picky but still hit fast-moving lures.</li>
                        <li><strong>Optimal Times:</strong> Dawn and dusk are prime, or anytime you see active surface feeding.</li>

                <div class="details-content mt-3">
                    <p>For the truly big fish that patrol the deeper waters around the pier, live bait is often the key.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Target Species:</strong> King Mackerel, Cobia, Tarpon, large "Bull" Red Drum, Sharks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recommended Rigs:</strong> Specialized "King Rigs" (often multi-hook rigs with wire leaders), heavy bottom rigs with large circle hooks (for Drum/Sharks). Heavy fluorocarbon or wire leaders are essential.</li>
                        <li><strong>Best Baits:</strong> Live finger mullet, pinfish, croaker, bluefish, menhaden. Catching your own live bait with a Sabiki rig is highly recommended.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Often done from the very end of the pier or T-heads. For Kings, a "pin rig" allows the live bait to swim freely. For Drum/Sharks, a heavy bottom rig with a large live bait is cast out and allowed to sit. Patience is key, and be ready for a powerful fight!</li>
                        <li><strong>Optimal Times:</strong> Often during migratory runs (spring and fall for Kings/Cobia), late summer for Tarpon. Night fishing can be excellent for large Drum and Sharks.</li>

                        <li><strong>Recommended Rig:</strong> A simple jig head (1/4 to 1 oz depending on current) with a live minnow or soft plastic bait. A Carolina rig with a live minnow can also be effective.</li>
                        <li><strong>Best Baits:</strong> Live minnows (especially mud minnows), small live shrimp, Gulp! soft plastics (like shrimp or grub imitations).</li>
                        <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Cast your bait out and retrieve it very slowly, bouncing or dragging it along the bottom. Flounder will often be found near structure like pilings, rocks, or ledges. Feel for a subtle "thump" or increased weight.</li>
                        <li><strong>Optimal Times:</strong> Active in warmer months (late spring through fall), especially around structure and near inlets.</li>

                    <p>Sheepshead are notorious bait stealers with a very subtle bite, but they are delicious and a fun challenge.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Target Species:</strong> Sheepshead.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recommended Rig:</strong> A very small, strong hook (size 1 or 1/0) on a short leader, often with just a small split shot or no weight at all.</li>
                        <li><strong>Best Baits:</strong> Fiddler crabs are by far the best. Small pieces of clam or shrimp can also work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Drop your bait straight down right next to barnacle-covered pilings. These fish nibble very gently. You'll feel a faint "tap-tap" before the actual bite. Set the hook quickly and firmly at the first sign of a bite.</li>
                        <li><strong>Optimal Times:</strong> Warmer months when they are actively feeding on barnacles around pier pilings.</li>

                    <p>Fresh, live bait is almost always superior for tempting larger predatory fish. A Sabiki rig is your key to a fresh bait supply.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Target Species:</strong> Pinfish, cigar minnows, pilchards, small Spanish Mackerel.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recommended Rig:</strong> A multi-hook Sabiki rig with small flies, typically with a small sinker (1/2 - 1 oz) attached to the bottom snap.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technique:</strong> When you see small baitfish dimpling the surface, or hear reports of bait schools, drop your Sabiki rig down into the school. Gently jig it up and down. The tiny flies on the rig will trick the baitfish into biting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Optimal Times:</strong> Whenever bait is schooling near the pier, often in the morning or evening.</li>

                <div class="details-content mt-3">
                    <p>Many piers are lit at night, and these lights act as a beacon for baitfish, which in turn attract larger predatory fish. Night fishing can be incredibly productive for species like Red Drum, Speckled Trout, and various shark species.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Less crowded, cooler temperatures, many nocturnal feeders.</li>
                        <li><strong>Target Species:</strong> Red Drum, Speckled Trout, Sharks, Croaker, Spot.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Fish directly under or just outside the halo of the pier lights. Use live or cut bait on bottom rigs.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rising Pressure:</strong> Often indicates stable, clear weather and can improve fishing as fish become more active.</li>
                        <li><strong>Falling Pressure (Pre-Storm):</strong> Can trigger a feeding frenzy right before a weather front moves in, as fish sense the change and feed aggressively.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stable Pressure:</strong> Generally leads to consistent fishing, assuming other conditions are favorable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rapid Changes:</strong> Extreme changes in pressure can sometimes cause fish to shut down and become less active.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Winds from the Ocean (East/Southeast):</strong> Can push bait closer to shore and often bring in cleaner, cooler water, which can be good for migratory species.</li>
                        <li><strong>Winds from the Land (West/Northwest):</strong> Can calm the nearshore waters, but might also push warmer, murkier water offshore. Can make casting easier if it's at your back.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strong Winds:</strong> Can make fishing difficult due to casting challenges and strong currents. Fish might hold tighter to structure.</li>

        <section id="etiquette-safety" class="page-content content-section" style="display: none;">
            <h2>Carolina Clyde's Pier Etiquette & Safety Guide</h2>
            <p>These are the rules of the pier, young man. Follow them, and you'll earn respect and have a safer, more enjoyable time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Respect the Space:</strong> Piers get crowded. Be mindful of others' lines and give people room. Don't cast too close to another angler.</li>
                <li><strong>Look Before You Cast:</strong> Always, always take a quick glance around. Make sure your cast won't tangle with another line or hit anyone. A little awareness prevents a lot of headaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Clean Up Your Act:</strong> You bring it out, you take it back. Dispose of all your trash, old line, and bait containers in designated bins. Leaving trash harms the environment and is disrespectful to everyone.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect the Fish:</strong> If you're not keeping a fish, release it quickly and gently. Learn how to handle fish properly, minimize their time out of water, and use a de-hooker to get the hook out safely.</li>
                <li><strong>Know the Rules:</strong> This is CRITICAL! Always check the current North Carolina fishing regulations for fishing licenses, size limits, and bag limits. Regulations can change frequently. You can find up-to-date info on the NC Division of Marine Fisheries website.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety First:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Watch out for slippery spots, exposed nails, and loose boards on the pier.</li>
                        <li>Pay attention to weather forecasts, especially for lightning. If a storm is brewing, head inside.</li>
                        <li>Have a basic first-aid kit for minor cuts or scrapes.</li>
                        <li>Use a drop net for all but the smallest fish. I can't stress this enough. Never try to hoist a fish onto the pier with just your rod and reel alone – you'll snap your rod, lose your fish, or both. A drop net is essential for landing fish safely.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
             <h3>Important Considerations for Pier Fishing:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pier Fees:</strong> Most private piers charge a daily fishing fee. State-owned piers (like Jennette's) also have fees. This fee usually covers your blanket fishing license for that pier.</li>
                <li><strong>Check Reports:</strong> Always check the pier's website or call them for the most current fishing reports. This will tell you what's actually biting and what conditions are like.</li>
                <li><strong>Crowds:</strong> Popular piers can get very crowded, especially on weekends and during peak season. Patience and pier etiquette are key.</li>
                <li><strong>Pier Rules:</strong> Each pier has its own specific rules regarding types of bait, number of rods, gaffing, cleaning fish, etc. Always read these rules upon arrival.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="hot-tips" class="page-content content-section" style="display: none;">
            <h2>Carolina Clyde's Hot Tips for Pier Success</h2>
            <p>This is where the wisdom comes in. These are the little things that make a big difference.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fish the Tides:</strong> Fish activity is often tied to the movement of water. Aim to fish one hour before and one hour after high tide, and one hour before and one hour after low tide. These "slack" periods, when the tide is changing direction, are often prime feeding times as baitfish are moved by the current.</li>
                <li><strong>Go Early/Late:</strong> Dawn and dusk are often the best times for fishing. That low light brings out many fish, and it's usually quieter on the pier.</li>
                <li><strong>Observe Like a Hawk:</strong> When you first get to the pier, don't just cast out right away. Take a few minutes to watch what other successful anglers are doing. What rigs are they using? What bait are they putting on their hooks? Where are they casting? This local knowledge is invaluable.</li>
                <li><strong>Fish the Structure:</strong> Those pier pilings, any submerged artificial reefs, or even changes in the bottom depth (like troughs or sandbars) all attract fish seeking food or shelter. Cast near these areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Read the Water:</strong> Look for signs of baitfish activity – little ripples, jumping fish. Watch for diving birds, which often means baitfish schools are nearby. Even subtle changes in water color can point to deeper pockets where fish might be hiding.</li>
                <li><strong>Patience is a Virtue:</strong> Fishing isn't always about constant action. Sometimes, it's about waiting, enjoying the quiet, and feeling the peace. Don't get discouraged if you don't catch something right away. The bite can turn on suddenly!</li>
                <li><strong>Master Your Knots:</strong> I can't say this enough. Practice your knots at home until you can tie them quickly and correctly, especially that FG Knot. A strong, reliable knot is your strongest link to the fish. It's where battles are won or lost.</li>
                <li><strong>Set Your Drag Correctly:</strong> Your 8000 reel has a powerful drag. When you're fighting a fish, your drag should be set so that the line peels off steadily when the fish pulls hard, without breaking. A good starting point is about 1/3 of your leader's breaking strength. Always check it by pulling line directly from the reel before you cast.</li>
                <li><strong>Bring a Rod Holder:</strong> A sand spike or a pier-specific rod holder is a wise investment. It keeps your rod secure while you're waiting for a bite or attending to other gear, preventing it from getting pulled into the water.</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace the Journey:</strong> Fishing is more than just catching fish. It's about learning, adapting, connecting with nature, and building character. Every trip teaches you something new. Share your knowledge, celebrate your successes, and learn from every challenge.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="closed-piers" class="page-content content-section" style="display: none;">
            <h2>Important Advisory: Currently Closed Piers</h2>
            <p>The dynamic nature of coastal infrastructure means pier accessibility can change. Always verify a pier's operational status before your trip.</p>
            <h3>A. Holden Beach Pier: Current Status and Impact on Fishing</h3>
            <p>The Holden Beach Pier is presently <strong>closed for fishing</strong> and will remain so until further notice. The Town of Holden Beach, which recently acquired the pier properties, conducted an assessment revealing that the structure has "likely surpassed its remaining service life" and requires immediate, substantial maintenance. Both the pier and its adjacent buildings are currently inaccessible to the public.</p>
            <p>This closure represents a significant loss of a key fishing location in the southern coastal region. Anglers should seek alternatives like Ocean Isle Beach Pier or consider charter services.</p>
            <h3>B. Carolina Beach Pier: Current Status and Impact on Fishing</h3>
            <p>Similarly, the Carolina Beach Pier is currently <strong>closed for fishing</strong> until further notice. The closure is attributed to the end of the pier being inaccessible due to anticipated repairs.</p>
            <p>Anglers planning to fish in this vicinity should explore alternatives such as Kure Beach Pier, surf fishing, or local charter services.</p>
            <p>The explicit closure of these piers due to structural deficiencies, coupled with rebuilding efforts at others like Avalon Pier, underscores a critical aspect of pier fishing: access is not guaranteed. Always verify current operational status via official websites, phone calls, or social media updates.</p>

                    <h4>Pier Profile: Length, Unique Features, History</h4>
                    <p>The Ocean Isle Beach Pier, a substantial 968-foot wooden structure, has served as a prominent landmark on the island since its construction in 1957 by Odell and Virginia Williamson. Situated centrally on the 7-mile island, at the terminus of Causeway Drive, the pier's management prioritizes upholding family traditions and honoring its rich history while concurrently implementing updates to cater to contemporary tourists. The pier complex encompasses a pier grill, a gift shop, an arcade featuring a large, modern, and air-conditioned room, and an ice cream parlor renowned for its Blue Bell hand-dipped and soft-serve ice cream. Anglers benefit from strategically placed wooden benches along the pier's entire length, providing comfortable spots for casting and observation.</p>

                    <h4>Common Catches: Typical Sizes & Abundance</h4>
                    <p>Recent reports: "nice hard pulling black drum," "nice speckled trout." Also: Redfish, Flounder, Tiger Sharks (7-foot specimen fought), Hammerheads, Sharpnose, Sandbar sharks, Gray Trout, Spanish Mackerel, Sea Bass. Live shrimp & menhaden attract predators.</p>
                    <h4>Angler's Edge: Recommended Baits, Rigs, & Techniques</h4>
                    <p><strong>Best Baits:</strong> Live shrimp (universal), menhaden (for predators). For Redfish/Trout/Flounder: lures. For Black Drum (kids' trips): live bait. For Mahi Mahi: smaller deep-diving lures. Cut bait for larger game fish. Fiddler crabs for Sheepshead.</p>
                    <p><strong>Optimal Times for Bait/Species:</strong> Morning best in summer. Shark fishing charters available from May onwards. Bottom-fishing year-round. Trolling for King Mackerel, Spanish Mackerel, Cobia (spring-fall).</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Techniques:</strong> Lure fishing (inshore), trolling (nearshore/offshore), bottom-fishing, shark charters.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wind:</strong> SE improves fishing, SW good summer. NW pushes bait. North often decreases success.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tides/Current:</strong> Incoming tide brings cleaner water, active fish. Outgoing tide concentrates fish. Slack tide can be slower. Strong current means fish often position behind structure; cast bait upstream.</p>
                    <p><strong>Barometric Pressure:</strong> Rising pressure improves fishing. Falling pressure (pre-storm) can trigger feeding frenzy. Stable pressure is consistent. Extreme changes can shut down fish.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ideal Weather:</strong> Light/moderate winds (5-15 knots), stable/rising barometer, clear/partly cloudy, moderate current.</p>

                    <h4>Pier Profile: Length, Unique Features</h4>
                    <p>Built 1954 by Lewis Orr. 850 ft long. Good for fishing & strolling. Fully lit at night. Jolly Roger Inn guests: free walking, discounted fishing. Facilities: tackle shop (pier, surf, sound, offshore), rod rentals, ice, snacks, and beverages.</p>
                    <h4>Seasonal Fishing Guide: Peak Seasons & Target Species</h4>
                    <p><strong>Spring (Mid-Mar-May):</strong> Virginia Mullet (whiting), Black Drum. Bluefish (1-3 lbs, then "chopper blues" 5-20 lbs late Mar). Puppy Drum and Flounder become more active around April 1st. Spanish Mackerel (1-5 lbs) appear in late April. May is considered the pinnacle of the spring season, bringing in warmer water species such as Cobia and King Mackerel.</p>
                    <p><strong>Summer (June-August):</strong> Offers a wide variety of catches, including King Mackerel, Spanish Mackerel, Bluefish, Flounder, Puppy Drum, Black Drum, Sheepshead, Pompano, Spots, Summer Whiting, and Cobia. Tarpon, some weighing over 100-120 lbs, are observed in remarkable numbers, particularly from July to August.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fall (September-November):</strong> Sees a resurgence of Drum (including slot and over-the-slot sizes), Pompano, Blues, Virginia Mullet, Black Drum, and Jumping Mullet. Spanish Mackerel, Speckled Trout, Flounder, and Spots also remain active.</p>
                    <h4>Common Catches: Typical Sizes & Abundance</h4>
                    <p>Historical reports from 2010-2018 indicate a range of common catches and sizes: King Mackerel (20-40 lbs), Tarpon (60-100 lbs, with a 66 lb specimen landed), Puppy Drum (up to 8 lbs), Sheepshead (a notable 8 lb 15 oz catch), Spanish Mackerel (4.5-7.2 lbs), Black Drum (7 lbs, 8.2 lbs), and Flounder (up to 3.5 lbs). Anglers have reported "tons of mullet," "good run of blues," and "lots of Spanish around," suggesting varying levels of abundance for different species throughout the seasons.</p>
                    <h4>Angler's Edge: Recommended Baits, Rigs, & Techniques</h4>
                    <p><strong>Best Baits:</strong> For Virginia Mullet and Black Drum: fresh shrimp (best), artificial shrimp, clams, and bloodworms. For Bluefish and Spanish Mackerel: Gotcha-plugs, Clarkspoons, and Diamond Jigs (for Spanish), while cut bait or artificial lures are also effective for blues. A quick retrieve is recommended for Spanish Mackerel. For Puppy Drum and Flounder: artificial baits such as Berkley Gulp or bucktails, fresh cut bait, live minnows, and live shrimp are productive. For Cobia and King Mackerel: Live baits like bluefish, menhaden, and grass shad, often using a specific live bait rig for King Mackerel. For Spots and Mullet: Bloodworms.</p>
                    <p><strong>Optimal Times for Bait/Species:</strong> Spanish Mackerel best during "low light" (early AM, late PM, after dark) in summer months. Bloodworms for Spots/Mullet at night.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Techniques:</strong> Bottom rigs for Mullet/Drum. Quick retrieve for Spanish. Drop near pilings. Fish up-current side. "Pier trolling" (walking along the pier while towing a lure or bait) and "pier chumming" can also generate increased action. A "bridge net" is a useful tool for landing larger fish.</p>
                    <h4>Optimal Conditions: Tides, Time of Day, Weather Insights</h4>
                    <p><strong>Water Temperature:</strong> Follows seasonal trends for NC coast.</p>
                    <p><strong>Time of Day:</strong> "Low light" (early AM, late PM, after dark) for Spanish Mackerel, especially in summer months.</p>
                    <p><strong>Wind:</strong> South or Southwest wind is preferable for mullet, while SE to SW winds (0-20 mph) are ideal for Spanish Mackerel. Easterly winds can help clear the water and concentrate baitfish closer to the beach. Wind direction impacts casting.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tides/Current:</strong> Tide times available, specific optimal stages not detailed, but general principles of moving tides activating fish apply. Easterly winds can clear water and concentrate bait.</p>
                    <p><strong>Barometric Pressure:</strong> Not specifically mentioned for Jolly Roger, but general principles apply (rising pressure good, falling can trigger pre-storm feeding).</p>
